# KotlinBasicsInAndroidStudio
Some basic concepts in Kotlin implemented in an Android Studio Project
The application Android-wise only displays a Hello World.
TargetSDKVersion - 30.
MinSDKVersion - 23.
Have these versions in mind when creating a virtual device or using your own in developer mode.
There are comments in the code explaining some of the logic behind the implementations and each of the cases but some are in Spanish.
Each Case uses warnings to display the behaviour of each code executed. When running the app you need to view the Logcat and select the Warnings which will allow you to view each output of the functions and operations.
Some classes may not log results; every class has to be called from the mainActivity.kt file in order to be exectued.
